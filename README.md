# 11dotjs is HTML5 without HTML
11dotjs (pronounced like "eleven.js") is an open-source TypeScript / JavaScript project. It’s **not** a framework, or API, and it’s **not** opinionated. 11dotjs **is** independent of all web-authoring frameworks, so you can use it with or without any of them. Its only dependency is your browser.
## Goals
- Share free, lightweight, ready-to-use web components with the masses. 
- Promote a web-authoring model based on Objects instead of HTML.
## Turn your code up to eleven with 11dotjs.
With the **11dotjs** web-authoring model, you can 
- Code your UI in intuitive JSON.
- Call **11dotjs** generators to add structures like tables.
- Write your own generators.
- Invoke the **11dotjs DocComposer** to convert your UI object graph directly to the browser’s DOM document.
