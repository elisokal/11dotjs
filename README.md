# 11dotjs is HTML5 without HTML
11dotjs (pronounced like "eleven.js") is an open-source TypeScript / JavaScript project. It’s **not** a framework, or API, and it’s **not** opinionated. 11dotjs **is** independent of all web-authoring frameworks, so you can use it with or without any of them. Its only dependency is the TypeScript compiler and your browser.
## Goals
- Share free, lightweight, ready-to-use web components with the masses. 
- Promote a web-authoring model based on JSON instead of HTML.
## Turn your code up to eleven with 11dotjs.
With the **11dotjs** web-authoring model, you code the UI in intuitive JSON, then invoke the **11dotjs Composer** to convert the JSON directly to the browser’s DOM document. 
## See a Demo
Intuitive Color Palette, the first **11dotjs** component, contains neither static nor generated HTML. There’s a demo at http://elisokal.com/11dotjs/colorPaletteDemo2.html.
