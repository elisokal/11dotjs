Do the web APIs offer a standard approach to making <th> be non-scrolling?
ChatGPT
Making <th> elements non-scrolling (i.e., keeping table headers fixed while the table body scrolls) can be achieved using a combination of HTML, CSS, and sometimes JavaScript. While there isn't a specific web API dedicated to this task, modern CSS provides a relatively standard way to accomplish this using position: sticky.

CSS position: sticky
The position: sticky CSS property is a straightforward and effective way to make table headers (or any other elements) stick to the top of their container when scrolling.

Example:
Here's how you can use position: sticky to make table headers non-scrolling:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>Fixed Table Headers</title>
  <style>
    table {
      border-collapse: collapse;
      width: 100%;
    }
    th {
      position: sticky;
      top: 0;
      background-color: #f1f1f1;
      z-index: 1; /* Ensure it stays above table cells */
    }
    th, td {
      border: 1px solid #ddd;
      padding: 8px;
    }
    tbody {
      display: block;
      height: 300px; /* Set the desired height */
      overflow: auto;
      width: 100%;
    }
    thead, tbody tr {
      display: table;
      width: 100%;
      table-layout: fixed; /* Ensure columns have a fixed layout */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <table>
    <thead>
      <tr>
        <th>Header 1</th>
        <th>Header 2</th>
        <th>Header 3</th>
        <th>Header 4</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
      <!-- Repeat this row to simulate content -->
      <tr>
        <td>Data 1</td>
        <td>Data 2</td>
        <td>Data 3</td>
        <td>Data 4</td>
      </tr>
      <!-- Add more rows as needed -->
    </tbody>
  </table>
</body>
</html>
Explanation:
HTML Structure: The table has a <thead> for headers and a <tbody> for the body.
CSS Styles:
position: sticky on the <th> elements makes them stick to the top of the container when scrolling.
top: 0 ensures the headers stick to the top of the scrolling container.
background-color and z-index ensure the headers remain visible above the table content.
The tbody is given a fixed height and overflow: auto to allow scrolling.
display: block on tbody and table-related styles ensure the columns remain aligned correctly.
Browser Compatibility
position: sticky is well-supported in modern browsers. However, you may need to include vendor prefixes for full compatibility with older browsers:

css
Copy code
th {
  position: -webkit-sticky; /* Safari */
  position: sticky;
  top: 0;
  background-color: #f1f1f1;
  z-index: 1;
}
JavaScript (Optional)
In cases where CSS alone does not achieve the desired result, you might use JavaScript to dynamically adjust the positioning of the table headers. However, for most use cases, position: sticky should suffice.

By leveraging position: sticky, you can achieve non-scrolling table headers in a standard and widely supported way using just CSS.
